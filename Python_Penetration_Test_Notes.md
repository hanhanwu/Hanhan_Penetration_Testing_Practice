OVERVIEW

* Python, Ruby and Perl are <b>interpreted languages</b>, the code will be turned into machine leanguage and execute. C, C++ are compiled languages, they will be compiled before running, and therefore they are faster. But, compiled code is generated for a specific system type and distribution, cannot be moved through a geterogeneous environment (an environment that has ultiple system types and different distributions), while interpreted code can be portable as long as the interpreter is avilable.
