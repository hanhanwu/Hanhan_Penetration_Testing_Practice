These are the notes taken when I'm quickly going through a book called [Machine Learning in Penetration Testing][1]

## Overall
* I think the machine learning used in this book is too basic, some methods will raise real data scientists' concern. Cannot say I recommend this book. Reading it just to learn some penetration testing related knowledge.
