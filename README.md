INTRODUCTION

I am taking every effort to learn cyber security broader and deeper! Red team penetration testing looks so cool! I can't wait to try it!

  * Denial of Service
  * SQL Injection
* [Python Penetration Testing Essentials][4]
  * Network, Scanning, Sniffing
  * Others are similar to the above one

  * Assessment & Attacks are good to check
  * Exploits are done in Linux
* [Advanced Penetration Testing for Highly-Secured Environments: The Ultimate Security Guide][5]
  * As you can see, it's advanced!
  
*****************************************************************

Power Tools

* HashCat - Cracking Passwords
  * [Github][6]
  * [All Details][7]
  * [How to use HashCat][8]
  * [HashGan Paper][12] - It says it's better than HashCat. At this moment, I didn't find the tool online or open source
  
* Metasploit - Penetrating Testing Framework
  * Official Site: https://metasploit.com/
    * Get Started: https://metasploit.com/get-started
  * [GitHub][9]
  * [Metasploitable3][10] - A VM that contains large amount of security vulnerabilities
  
* Thc-Hydra - Gain unauthorized access from remote to system
  * [GitHub][11]
  * It is proof of concept code, for leagal use only
  * In Metasploit, by default, account `msfadmin` has the same password as this username
    * Type `hydra -l msfadmin -p msfadmin -f -V 192.168.195.145 ssh`, to launch hydra to against ssh service
